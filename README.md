## Saint Margrethen

Saint Margrethen is a landing page I built to get a better understanding of HTML and CSS concepts about two months into my coding journey. It is a static site currently but with everything I have learnt so far, I am making it responsive with Media queries, improving its file structure and making it more accessible using WCAG guidelines.

It is a site for an information Technology company that provides contemporary software developement solutions. 

## Goal

My goal for this project is to move beyond knowing just concepts related to React and get hands-on experience while polishing my skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI and Javascript.

## Tools

The tools I used are:

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|VS code|IDE|
|Bootstrap, Vanilla CSS and Material Design lite |Styling|
|Git and GitHub|Version control|

## UI Design

The proposed UI design is seen below:
